# Marks aggregator

Made to be used to calculate marks of subjects and find the average mark of all the subjects

Basic program made in python using tkinter and ttk libraries

Made as a **basic coding project for fun during break times of mine**

## Issues
- Code base is very unclean with many typos and shit
- the output list is init with str when float is being inserted into it
- More sutable variable names should be found and used
- code should be more structured

## compiled binaries
- **Windows**
    - Download it from the github releases page [here](https://github.com/randomidiot2887/basic-mark-aggregator-program-python-tkinter/releases/tag/version-1.0.1_
- **Linux**
    - Download it from the girhub releases page [here](https://github.com/randomidiot2887/basic-mark-aggregator-program-python-tkinter/edit/main/readme.md)

Only **AMD64** devices are supported. tho it could be compiled for any other architecure that supports tkinter and python

you should be able to **compile** it using pyinstaller tho to make an executable binary

No, i didnt make it os specific i think
